# tickbox

free task management software you can mod however you want

## why tickbox?

this is completely free and open-source software that has _zero_ communication with any servers, trackers, 3rd parties, etc. Data is only stored locally in the browser using `localStorage`.

since it's open source, you can mod it however you want: change the theme, have it store your todos in a database, integrate with various APIs, add user signup, etc.
